# Matrix-Math

Implementation of matrix methods and polynomial interpretation in Java and C++. 

* Java Matrix implementation that calculates integrals, derivatives, and interpolates functions. Uses variety of Riemann Sums for integrals; can perform row reduction, inversion, and basic row operations. 

* C++ implementation provides matrix object with row operations, row reduction, and inversion. Also includes implementations of polynomial and exploential function objects.
